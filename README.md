# Security project

 this program will help with increasing privacy of a device you the program on.

## The Algorithm

The program is going to have access to live camera feed from a certain camera on the device. It will see if an object is approaching the device. Then it will define if the object is a person or not. then if it's a person the program will see if the person is you or not. if it's not you then the program is going to send you a message via e-mail.
